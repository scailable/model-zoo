# Gauge Reader Model

The Gauge Reader Model is a pre-trained AI solution designed to detect and locate key components of a gauge: the **start point (E - Empty)**, the **end point (F - Full)**, and the **needle position**. This model is optimized for seamless integration into industrial monitoring and automation systems.

## Overview

This model is specifically tailored to read analog gauges under various conditions, such as different lighting, angles. It is a valuable tool for automating the monitoring of tank levels, pressure gauges, and other industrial instruments.

## Key Features

- **Custom Training**: Trained on a diverse dataset of one-gauge images.
- **Versatility**: Capable of detecting gauge components in both static and dynamic environments.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports real-time gauge reading for live monitoring and automated systems.
- **Configurable Settings**:
  - Adjustable confidence threshold for detection sensitivity.
  - Define a Region of Interest (ROI) to focus detection on specific gauges.

## Use Cases

The Gauge Reader Model is ideal for a variety of applications, including:

### Industrial Automation
- Monitor tank levels, pressure gauges, and other instruments in real time.
- Automate data logging and alert systems based on gauge readings.

### Energy and Utilities
- Ensure accurate fuel or gas level readings in power plants.
- Monitor water levels in reservoirs or industrial processes.

### Transportation
- Automate fuel level monitoring in vehicles or storage facilities.
- Support maintenance by tracking gauge readings in locomotives or ships.

### Research and Development
- Analyze the behavior of physical systems based on real-time gauge data.
- Enhance experimental setups requiring precise monitoring of levels or pressure.
