# YOLO Series Models (v4 to v11) Trained on COCO

This document covers a series of YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models ranging from **YOLOv4** to **YOLOv11**, all trained on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. These models are designed to detect a wide range of objects in images and video feeds, leveraging state-of-the-art architectures for fast and accurate performance.

## Overview

The YOLO series is a family of real-time object detection models known for their speed and accuracy. Each version introduces architectural improvements and optimization techniques, making the later versions more powerful and efficient. These models are pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which includes 80 object classes such as people, vehicles, animals, and everyday items.


## General Capabilities

- **Pre-Trained on COCO**: Detects 80 object classes out of the box.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Optimized for high-speed detection in images and video feeds.
- **Scalability**: Models range from lightweight versions for mobile devices to highly accurate ones for powerful GPUs.
- **Configurable Parameters**:
  - Adjustable confidence thresholds for detection.
  - Support for real-time streaming.

## Use Cases

These YOLO models are applicable across a variety of domains:

### Retail
- Real-time inventory monitoring using object detection.
- Customer behavior analysis through object tracking.

### Autonomous Vehicles
- Detect and classify vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
- Support advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

### Healthcare
- Analyze medical images for object detection tasks like tumor localization.
- Detect surgical instruments during procedures.

### Surveillance
- Identify objects and people in real-time for security monitoring.
- Automate anomaly detection in video feeds.

### Robotics
- Object recognition for robotic manipulation tasks.
- Enable autonomous navigation using scene understanding.

## Performance and Testing

To evaluate the models:

1. Select the specific YOLO version suitable for your requirements.
2. Test the model on images or video feeds using the pre-trained weights.
