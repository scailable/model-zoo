# Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detection Model

The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Detection Model is a pre-trained AI solution designed to identify and locate personal protective equipment, such as helmets, gloves, masks, and vests, in images or video feeds. This model is optimized for seamless integration into safety monitoring and compliance enforcement applications.

## Overview

This model is specifically tailored to detect PPE under diverse workplace conditions, including varying lighting, angles, and obstructions. It is a valuable tool for ensuring workplace safety, automating compliance checks, and enhancing safety protocols.

## Key Features

- **Custom Training**: Trained on a dataset of PPE images to detect various equipment types and configurations.
- **Versatility**: Effective in detecting PPE across diverse industries and environments.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports real-time detection for safety monitoring and incident prevention.
- **Configurable Settings**:
  - Adjustable confidence threshold for detection sensitivity.
  - Define a Region of Interest (ROI) to focus detection on specific areas.

## Use Cases

The PPE Detection Model is ideal for a variety of applications, including:

### Construction
- Monitor compliance with safety protocols on construction sites.
- Identify workers without required PPE in real time.

### Manufacturing
- Enhance safety monitoring in industrial environments.
- Automate compliance checks for gloves, helmets, and other protective equipment.

### Healthcare
- Ensure proper usage of PPE like masks and gloves in medical settings.
- Support infection control measures by monitoring PPE compliance.

### Mining
- Track helmet and visibility vest usage in hazardous work areas.
- Identify PPE violations to prevent accidents and injuries.
