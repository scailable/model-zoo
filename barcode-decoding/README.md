# Barcode Detection

The Barcode Detection model is a pre-trained AI model that detects the location of barcodes in images. It is based on the Yolov8 architecture and is optimized for seamless integration with the Network Optix platform.

## Use cases

The Barcode Detection model can be used in various applications, including:

- Retail: Detecting barcodes on products for inventory management and pricing.
- Logistics: Scanning barcodes on packages for tracking and sorting.
- Healthcare: Identifying barcodes on medical supplies for inventory control.

## Model details

- Based on Yolov8-medium architecture.
- Trained on a custom dataset of barcode images.
- Optimized for detecting barcodes in various lighting conditions and orientations.
- Supports real-time barcode detection in images.
- Provides a way to control the model confidence threshold for detecting barcodes, as well as specifying a region of interest (ROI) for scanning.
- The input resolution of the model is 640x640 pixels.
