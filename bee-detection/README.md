# Bee Detection Model

The Bee Detection Model is a pre-trained AI solution designed to identify and locate bees in images or video feeds. This model is optimized for seamless integration into various environmental monitoring and research applications.

## Overview

This model is specifically tailored to detect bees under diverse environmental conditions, such as backgrounds and movement. It is a valuable tool for ecological research, agriculture, and conservation efforts.

## Key Features

- **Custom Training**: Trained on a dataset of bee images to handle diverse scenarios, including different species and behaviors.
- **Versatility**: Effective in detecting bees in dynamic and complex environments.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports real-time detection for live monitoring applications.
- **Configurable Settings**:
  - Adjustable confidence threshold for detection sensitivity.
  - Define a Region of Interest (ROI) to focus detection on specific areas.

## Use Cases

The Bee Detection Model is ideal for a variety of applications, including:

### Agriculture
- Monitor pollination activity in crops.
- Assess bee populations in agricultural settings.

### Environmental Research
- Study bee behavior and movement patterns in natural habitats.
- Conduct population surveys for ecological conservation efforts.

### Conservation
- Track endangered bee species to support preservation efforts.
- Analyze the impact of environmental changes on bee populations.
